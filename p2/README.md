# Project 1
* By: Indri Himawan
* Prod URL: http://p2.indrihimawan.com/
* Old Repository: https://github.com/ihimawan/e28/tree/master/p1

## Outside resources
* Used Fontawesome (https://github.com/FortAwesome/vue-fontawesome)

## Notes
* I used the comprehensive approach. I created a brand new project using vue components and a router that isn't really used.
* __Added functionality__: to edit your profile
* __Functionality coming soon__: messaging functionality to other alpacas, counter to see how many conversations you initiated, received, and how many ghosted.

## Credits
