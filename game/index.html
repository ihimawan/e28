            <h1>Hoa (ho-a) The Boa</h1>
            <p>Despite being a species of large, heave-bodied snake, <strong>Hoa the Boa</strong> is a reptile whose
                been
                single for 24 years. He just never felt ready to talk to a lady Boa. However, after months and months
                of
                contemplating, he decided that <strong>TONIGHT IS THE NIGHT</strong> he's going to get the a lady
                boa that he's going to take home so his mom would finally be proud of him after all these years (he
                still
                lives with his mom). With this determination, so he went to the biggest reptile bar in town...

            <p>As if the stars align, across the bar, Hoa saw a lady boa who he's had a crush on since boa high school.
                Her
                name is <span class="sasha">Sssasha</span>. Oh lovely <span class="sasha">Sssasha</span>. The only
                problem is, he knows she doesn't like short boas. That's why she legally changed her name to have three
                S's in the begginning instead of just one. A rebel, that
                <span class="sasha">Sssasha</span>. And to make it worse, Hoa's high school enemy, <strong>Big Black
                    Cobra (BBC)</strong>, is seducing her right
                now. No, that is not his nickname; it's his actual name because his mommy was surprised when he found
                out
                how long he was as a wee young snek. So Hoa now needs to get long as quick as possible before
                <strong>BBC</strong> takes her home.</p>

            <p class="food">xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
            <p class="sub">Specimen A. The fine creature that is Sssasha.</p>


            <p>The only way Hoa would be able to grow long though, is to drink 30 pills of steroids lying around in the
                bar. But he needs an accomplice to be able to conduct this. It also has to be done in 3 minutes before
                <strong>BBC</strong> ssseduces <span class="sasha">Sssasha</span> so hard she would just go home with
                him. Can you help Hoa?</p>
