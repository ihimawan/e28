        <h1>Hoa The Boa</h1>
        <p>Despite being a species of large, heave-bodied snake, <strong>Hoa the Boa</strong> is a reptile whose been
            single for 24 years. He just never felt ready to talk to a lady Boa. However, after months and months of
            contemplating, he decided that <strong>TONIGHT IS THE NIGHT</strong> he's going to get the a lady
            boa that he's going to take home so his mom would finally be proud of him after all these years (he still
            lives with his mom). With this determination, he went to the biggest reptile bar in town.
        </p>

        <p>As if the stars align, across the bar, Hoa saw a lady boa who he's had a crush on since boa high school. The
            only problem is, he knows she doesn't like short boas. And to make it worse, his high school enemy, Brad,
            is seducing her right now. So Hoa needs to get long as quick as possible before Brad takes her home.</p>
