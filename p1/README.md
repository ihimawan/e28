# Project 1
* By: Indri Himawan
* Prod URL: http://llamaoralpaca.indrihimawan.com/

## Outside resources
* Bootstrap CSS (just because I want a somewhat good looking website with minimal skill): https://getbootstrap.com/
* Dynamic CSS https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/class-and-style.html

## Notes
* Whoever is using this website, I made the website quite intuitive. So there should not be any directions from me.
* I mean I think I went overboard. But it was fun times. 
* Driven by my hate towards people who don't know Llamas vs Alpacas.
* Also I'm getting `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'` on the logs at every startup. I couldn't find a way to make it go away.
