# Project 3
* By: Indri Himawan
* Prod URL: http://p3.indrihimawan.com/

## Outside resources

## Notes
* Used the fake API (https://my-json-server.typicode.com/ihimawan/e28JsonServer) to store all available user profiles to be displayed on the main dashboard and the game.
* Used local storage to store player information, such as name, gender, whether they have beaten the game, etc.
* __Functionality I want to do__: messaging functionality to other alpacas (computers, really). Right now it's just one way. You will never get messages from other users.

## Things I've probably could have done better
* Using a local storage key for each conversation, instead of consolidating all of them in one JSON as a value in one key in the local storage.
* Need to refresh to see messages badges to be updated
